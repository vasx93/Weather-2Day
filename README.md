# Weather-2Day

This is one of my first and favorite Node.js full stack projects. As a child my dream job was to be a meteorologist(or an astronaut). Naturally, since I've started with programming, I have developed an idea for a simple, yet neat, weather app.
Tech stack used for this project involves: Node.js, Express.js, HTML5, CSS3

The app is live on this link https://vr-weather2day-app.herokuapp.com/  and it displays current, daily and hourly forecast for a selected location/state/city/town/address.
